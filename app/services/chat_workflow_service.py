"""
FULL FILE — replace your existing backend/app/services/chat_workflow_service.py.

Citation building now also captures `file_id`, a `snippet` of matched
text, and — for OCR'd/scanned pages that have no embedded PDF text layer —
a `bbox` computed from the OCR word bounding boxes captured in
pdf_parser.py, via the new `_find_ocr_bbox` helper. Everything else is
unchanged: same decompose -> retrieve -> generate pipeline, same prompts,
same round-robin source grouping.
